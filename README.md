The All-Terrain Rover features a differential lever and a 6-wheel double-bogie suspension system, enabling smooth traversal over rough terrains and undefined paths. Its control system is powered by an Arduino Mega microcontroller, which actuates NEMA-17 BLDC motors for precise navigation through a skid-steering mechanism.

The navigation system integrates a QMC5883L magnetometer and a Ublox Neo 6M GPS module, allowing directional control and waypoint-based navigation. Waypoints are defined via a mobile application, and commands are transmitted to the robot using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

Tasks Completed:
- Forward and backward movement
- Left and right turns
- Route planning with up to 5 GPS waypoints
- Obstacle climbing along the route
- Traversing 4-inch tall grass
- Uphill movement on 40-degree inclined slopes
